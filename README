Production Volume Rendering
###########################

This is the companion rendering library for the book Production Volume
Rendering.

### Dependencies ###
####################

PVR depends on the following libraries:

  Imath/Iex/Half
  boost_thread
  HDF5
  OpenImageIO
  Field3D
  GPD            (Included in code distribution)

On MacOSX, all of the above except OpenImageIO are available from MacPorts, which 
helps simplify their installation.

### Building PVR ###
####################

After the code is checked out, cd into 'libpvr' and type 'scons -h'. This will 
list the available build targets.

scons lib
  Builds the shared library. (Which won't be of much use, but lets you check
  that the base builds ok.)

scons pylib
  Builds the python module, without installing it.

scons pyinstall
  Installs the python .so module and associated python files.
  This requires that you have set the PVR_PYTHON_PATH to indicate where the
  library gets installed. Typically this would be '~/python_libs', or something
  similar. The installation creates a 'pvr' directory in this path, and stores
  all the PVR python files there.

scons pypackage
  Creates a self-contained python module. This recursively analyzes which
  shared libraries the _pvr.so python module references, copies them to a
  libs/ subdir, and re-links the python module so that those are picked up
  upon import.

### Building on MacOSX Lion ###
###############################

The Python libraries that ship with OSX Lion are incompatible with GCC, and a 
small modification is required to the file "pyport.h". Scary, but necessary.

sudo emacs /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Headers/pyport.h

### Building on GNU/Linux Gentoo ###
####################################

Some Gentoo files are named different from what is assumed in the pvr
installation scripts, minor modifications are required:

The following example assumes python2.7 installation and will place everything
into pvr_dir/libpvr/install/linux2/g++/m64/release/python26/pvr.

First we need to define the directory where the python library will be installed:
$ cd pvr_dir/libpvr
$ export PVR_PYTHON_PATH="."

Depending on the installed python version, we may need to create a few
symbolic links to satisfy the dependencies:
$ cd /usr/lib
$ sudo ln -s ./libboost_python-2.7.so ./libboost_python.so
$ sudo ln -s ./libpython2.7.so ./libpython2.6.so
$ sudo ln -s pvr_dir/libpvr.so ./libpvr.so

Now things should get built.  Proceed as described in "Building PVR" section.

Finally, after the pvr pylib is built and installed, create a symlink to it:
$ cd /usr/lib/python2.7
$ sudo ln -s pvr_dir/libpvr/install/linux2/g++/m64/release/python26/pvr/ ./pvr
